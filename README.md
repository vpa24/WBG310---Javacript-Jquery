## Final Project for WBG310 Course

This is the website I developed for my final project in the 8-week WBG310 course. It showcases the knowledge and skills I acquired throughout the program and includes six pages:

- Home page: Provides an overview of the website.
- About Us page: Introduces me to the reader.
- Favorite Books page: Displays my top three favorite books and utilizes tabbed panels that I created in Week 7.
- Color Theory page: Allows users to select their favorite color and displays information about their personality based on color theory. This page uses animations and effects that I learned in Week 4.
- Vietnam Scenic page: Displays five images of the top five beautiful places in Vietnam. Each thumbnail image links to a larger version of the image and utilizes the techniques I learned in Week 5.
- Contact Us page: Includes a contact form that I created with jQuery validation techniques in Week 6.

Feel free to explore the website and let me know your thoughts. Thank you for checking it out!
