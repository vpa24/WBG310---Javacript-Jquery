            <h2>Favorite Color Yellow</h2>
            You enjoy learning and sharing knowledge with others, and you feel a
            need to always express your individuality.<br />
            Love yellow? This shows you have a vivid imagination, nervous
            energy, neatly-formed thoughts, and a need to help the world.<br />However,
            you tend to be aloof and are shy. You long to be respected and crave
            admiration for your wisdom. You’re a safe friend and a reliable
            confidant.
            <ul>
              <li>
                One of your most appealing traits is your consistently sunny and
                fun disposition.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your optimism is resolute and infectious even in the most trying
                circumstance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ignorance is bliss and you simply refuse to see the glass as
                half empty.
              </li>
              <li>
                You have a reputation of leaping before you look. Your
                impulsiveness sometimes pays off.
              </li>
              <li>
                While others are stalled by indecisiveness, your spontaneity and
                willingness to take action positions you several steps ahead of
                the competition.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your positive nature should not be misconstrued for extreme
                extraversion.
              </li>
              <li>You rarely sweat the small stuff</li>
              <li>
                You prefer tight-knit social circles to extended networks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Those who know you best describe you as happy, imaginative, and
                highly intellectual.

            <h2>Favorite Color Brown</h2>
            Your love of brown shows that you’re shrewd when it comes to money
            and obstinate in your habits and convictions. You are parsimonious,
            dependable, and steady. You disdain impulsiveness and are also a
            very good bargainer.
            <ul>
              <li>You relate to the simplicity of the color brown.</li>
              <li>
                You tend to be genuine and transparent with your intentions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Those who have hidden agendas and ulterior motives confuse you.
              </li>
              <li>
                You fail to see the value in twisting the facts when the truth
                is so much easier to manage.
              </li>
              <li>
                You are dependable and punctual and have high standards for
                excellence.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your positive nature should not be misconstrued for extreme
                extraversion.
              </li>
              <li>
                Experience has taught you that a solid foundation is mandatory
                for success. You do things slow and steady – do it right or not
                at all.
              </li>
              <li>No get rich quick schemes for you.</li>
              <li>
                You have little patience for the snake oil salesperson types.
